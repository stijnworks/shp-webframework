SHpartners Web Framework
===============================

What is the SHpartners Web Framework?
-------------------------------------

The SHpartners Web Framework is a micro framework that helps you with writing
[PHP](http://www.php.net/) web applications. It tries to be as simple yet as 
flexible as possible.

Also includes are different libraries that make writing web applications easier.

Last but not least, a micro CMS is included as well. The CMS doesn't require a 
database and stores it's contents in a flat-file storage based on JSON.

The framework was inspired by the [Sinitra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework 
for [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org).
